# Company and Project History
## 2021
## Huon Aquaculture 2019 - 2020
A significant cost in comercial aquaculture is incurred in mechanically cleaning algae from aquaculture nets. These costs can be minimised if accurate measurements can be automatically obtained, allowing net cleaning schedures to be accuately planned. Developed PyTorch tools to analyse algal growth on aquaculture nets from images provided by an unnderwater drone. The objective is to develop an autonomous drone that would navigate each of many aquaculture cages using compass heading, depth and AI analysis of net images.
## Saturn South P/L 2009 - 2019
Commenced operations to develop green technology power control and distribution
products in conjunction with the CSIRO and Energy Response Australia.
## University of Tasmania 2009 
Consult and provide design resources to the UTAS School of Physics developing
hardware and software for the internet-based control and monitoring of a 14 metre
radio telescope at Mt Pleasant Radio Astronomy site.
## Domain-42 P/L 2006 - 2008
Formed a company to provide technical development resources to third party
organizations. Obtained a contract with the CSIRO Astrophysics group to develop a
digital radio receiver for the SKAMP radio telescope array at the Molonglo site in
NSW. This device utilises FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology to
simultaneously receive, filter and correlate antenna signals from the 308 antennas of
the SKAMP linear radio telescope array. 
During development the receiver/correlator design was also incorporated in a
prototype Low Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) telescope array currently under
deployment in Western Australia under the auspices of Sydney University,
Massechusets Institute of Technolgy (MIT) and University of Southern California,
San Deigo (UCSD).
## Protel, now Altium Limited. 2004 – 2006.
Altium is an Australian company that develops and markets PC-based development
tools for the design and production of circuit schematics and printed circuit boards.
The product, named Altium Designer, is the worlds premier product for the PC
market segment and is sold worldwide.
My role with Altium was to build a development team of six electronic design
engineers to design and develop hardware and software tools that could incorporate
the recently developed (by Xilinx, Intel, Altera and others) Field Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA) technology into the Altium Designer product.
During this period of employment I assisted the University of Tasmania Physics
department in designing and producing an FPGA-based correlator.
## Aquasmart P/L 1992 – 2000
Adpative Fish Feeding systems – Designed and developed in Tasmania and exported
to many countries, these computer-based systems resulted in considerable efficiency
gains in many aspects of the aquaculture industry.
